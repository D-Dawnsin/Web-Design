	<h2>Physical Activity</h2>
	</div>
	<div id = "bodytext"><p>Growing up I always played a bunch of sports which included baseball, soccer, and football, because of this I went on to play both baseball, field, and football in highschool. However, now that I am in college my interests for these sports has stayed but my involvement in them has dwindled. Instead I work out at the gym because if there was one thing I learned while playing sports is that a healthy body leads to a healthy life and mind.</p>

	<h2>Video Games</h2>
	</div>
	<div id = "bodytext"><p>Funny enough as it is, even though I was an athlete growing up, and presently work out on a weekly basis, I love nothing more than video games. Growing up I played outside a lot, but I also played a lot of video games. I had access to a PS1 where I would constantly play Crash Bandicoot, and when I turned 4 or 5 I received my first gaming hardware called a GameBoy Advanced SP. This very system sparked the love I have for the Pokemon series. These two systems is all it took for me to grow up loving games and stay loving games to this date. Now I play a wide variety of games on all different platforms and try to support different Indie Development teams as much as possible!</p>

	<h2>Anime</h2>

	<div id = "bodytext"><p>Next to video games, I absolutely love watching anime. Most of the time I run into the issue that people do not believe I am the type of person to enjoy watching anime. However, watching anime is one of my biggest pass times and favorite hobbies. I started watching anime at about the age of 8 when my friend recommended the anime called Wolf's Rain. After watching this anime I really began to cassually watch anime on Netflix which would eventually evolving into watching anime almost daily to this date. My fvorite anime to date are...</p>

	<h2>Bringing it all Together</h2>
	</div>
	<div id = "bodytext"><p>As you can see, I am somewhat of a unique character. However, due to these impacts in my life I have been motivated to do plenty of amazing things. Since I have grown to love Japan and its culture I decided to make one of my majors at college Japanese and devote myself to learning all about their language and culture. I am also apart of the JSA (Japan Student Organization) here at Valparaiso University, because I want people to experience the joy of what Japanese culture is! Futhermore, since I have such a great love for games my other major is Computer Science. With this major in mind I plan to go forth in life pursuing the career of a Game Developer and hope to move to Cary, MC after college to apply to work at Epic or Insomniac Studios. Due to this passion, I am making sure to learn C++ this year and begin to create games in unreal engine. I have gone far enough to make a small indie Game Dev team here on campus in hopes to help form a portfolio for myself.</p>
