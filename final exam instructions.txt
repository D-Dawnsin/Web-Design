For your project you will need to build application so that involves user log-ins,
( meaning that users need to be able to log into the application )

There should is an existing table that stores users and log-in data. Youâ€™ll also need a way for 
users to enter their log-in data pages such as the Edit Profile page are only accessible after a 
successful log-in. 

 
Guildlines:

on-line auction, social media, photo portfolio,  etc ... )

if you prefer ( they can be sections of a page rather than separate pages -but in any case the 
navigation property will be needed to work )
